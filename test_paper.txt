1. Introduction
The crisis of global warming and shortage of fossil fuels are
being a motivation for the scientists as well as the institutes to
develop new energy conversion devices and environmentally
friendly fuels. One of the methods to solve the crises is using a
free-piston linear engine (FPLE). A free-piston linear engine is con-
sidered to be a crankless internal combustion engine with free
motion of piston in cylinder. In terms of structure, the engine

consists of two main components: the free-piston engine, and a
linear alternator. Unlike conventional engines with a crankshaft
mechanism, the combustion process of the FPLE can be optimized
through the variable compression ratios [1–14]. Besides, the varia-
tion of compression ratios in FPLE also allows the engine to operate
with various kinds of fuels as well as HCCI combustion [15–26]. In
general, the FPLE can be classified into three types including single
piston, dual piston and opposed piston [1]. Of there, the dual piston
engine has a higher power/weight ratio than others [26]. However,
the operation of the dual piston engine is mainly controlled by an
electronic system, and the piston crown may hit the cylinder head
if the piston is not controlled correctly [27–31]. Therefore, a damp-
ing device (e.g. metal spring) is needed to install in the engine for
avoiding the collision between the piston crown and cylinder head.
In a FPLE, one of the most important components is the linear alter-
nator or linear generator, which is used to start up the engine in
the beginning mode or motoring mode. Two kinds of linear
alternators used in the FPLE are tubular-type and flat-type linear
alternators. Therein, the flat-type linear alternator is rarely used
in FPLE, although it has higher efficiency, output voltage, and
current [32]. There were many previous studies for the dual piston
engine using tubular-type linear alternator. Atkinson et al. [33] pre-
sented a parametric study of a spark ignition dual piston engine
using the combination of two numerical models such as dynamic
model and thermodynamic model. Shoukry et al. [34] established
a series of dynamic and thermodynamic numerical equations to pre-
dict the behavior of a direct injection dual piston engine over a wide
operating range. In addition, there were many other simulation
studies for the dual piston engine, which could be found in
[35–43]. As can be seen above, most of the previous studies for
the dual piston engine focused only on simulation as well as numer-
ical analysis of this engine. Therefore, an experimental research is
needed to conduct on a dual free-piston engine to find out how is
the operation of the engine changed under real operating conditions.
This paper presents experiment and simulation study for a
power pack using the dual piston free-piston engine combined
with the flat-type linear generators. Therein, an experimental
study is presented as a main part of this paper. In the experimental
study, the effects of the main parameters such as input caloric
value, spark timing delay, equivalence ratio and air gap length on
the piston dynamics, electric power output and in-cylinder pres-
sure of the linear engine are investigated. To check the durability
of the linear engine, a durable test is carried out to examine the
behavior of the linear engine after 100 h of the durable test. Beside
experimental study, a simulation study is conducted to predict the
piston dynamics and electric power output of the linear engine
under the effects of key parameters such as reciprocating mass,
spark timing and spring stiffness. The operation of the linear
engine is modeled and simulated based on a combination of three
mathematical models including a dynamic model, a linear
alternator model and a thermodynamic model. The dynamic model
includes an analysis of the piston motion, based on Newton’s
second law. The linear alternator model includes an analysis of
electromagnetic force, which is considered to be a resistance force
for the piston motion. The thermodynamic model is used to
analysis thermodynamic processes in the engine cycle including
compression, combustion, expansion and scavenging processes.
Therein the scavenging process is assumed to be a perfect process.
The linear engine uses propane as a fuel, because propane has a
high octane number and can be easily mixed with air to make a
homogeneous charge.
2. Experimental study
2.1. Experimental apparatus
The experimental apparatus consists of the free-piston engine
with kind of dual piston, flat-type linear generators, ignition
device, sensor parts, engine control parts and data acquisition
parts. Figs. 1 and 2 show the photography and schematic diagram
of experimental system, respectively. The optical displacement
sensor (Kais Co.; KL3A-N1) is used to measure the position of trans-
lator in real time. Besides, the position of translator is detected by
two photo sensors (Sharp GP1S092HCPIF), and then a digital signal
generated from the photo sensor is delivered to ECU. After the

digital signal delivered to ECU is delayed as the set values by
Matlab-simulink, it is sent to an ignition coil (Dynatek ARC-2).
The delayed signal delivered from the ignition coil is again
delivered to spark plug mounted on the cylinder head to ignite
the air–fuel mixture in the cylinder. Fig. 3 shows a schematic of
the free-piston linear engine. Therein, a spark plug is placed
in the cylinder head to ignite the air/fuel mixture. A full stroke of
the piston is 31 mm and an effective stroke length is 18 mm. The
piston of the linear engine is combined with the translator of linear
generator and is controlled by ECU through the linear generator.
The schematic of the linear generator is shown in Fig. 4. The linear
generator consists of two main components, a stator and a transla-
tor. In the stator of linear generator, the copper windings are
wrapped around the back iron made of silicon steel. The perma-
nent magnets are mounted on the translator as a moving part.
In order to start the free-piston linear engine, the linear
generator will operate to drive the free-piston engine through
the connecting rod system. This stage is called the motoring mode.
After certain frequencies, the spark plugs are activated, and the
combustion process will occur alternatively at each cylinder,
forcing the connecting rod to move back and forth. The movement
of the connecting rod will generate current in the wires due to the
changing magnetic flux linked with the wire in the stator. This
stage is called the firing mode or electric power generation. Table 1
shows the specifications of the free-piston linear engine and the
experimental conditions.
2.2. Experimental methods
Firstly, for investigating the generating power according to the
input caloric value and electrical resistance, the air-propane mix-
ture was put into combustion chamber directly with the following
conditions: 4.56, 5.21, 5.88 and 6.53 kJ/s. The intake air flow rate
was varied at 70, 80, 90, 100 liter per minute (Lpm), while the
equivalence ratio is fixed at 1.0. Concurrently, electrical resistance
was applied from 5 X to 40 X. The other parameters such as spark
timing delay and air gap length (Lair_gap) were fixed at 1.0 ms and
2.0 mm, respectively. Afterwards, the linear engine performance
test was conducted.
Secondly, to investigate the effects of the spark timing delay on
the generating power of the linear engine, the spark timing was
varied at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 ms by using the Matlab/Simulink,
which was installed at ECU (DSP board). According to the first
experiments, the maximum electric power was induced when
the equivalence ratio and electrical resistance were 1.0 and 20 X,
respectively. Besides, the air gap length and input caloric value
were fixed at 2.0 mm and 5.88 kJ/s, respectively.
Thirdly, the experiment was performed to confirm generating
power of the linear engine according to the equivalence ratio.
The air flow rate was fixed as 90.0 Lpm before mixing with propane
and input caloric value was varied at 4.70, 5.29, 5.88, 6.46, and
7.05 kJ/s respectively. The equivalence ratio was varied from 0.8
to 1.2 with the increment of 0.1.
Finally, to investigate the effects of the air gap length on the
generating power of the linear engine, experiment was performed.
The air gap length was varied at 1.0 mm and 2.0 mm, while the
electrical resistance was varied at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 X,
respectively. The equivalence ratio was fixed at 1.0 by fixing the
air flow rate and input caloric value at 90.0 Lpm and 5.88 kJ/s,
respectively. The spark timing delay was fixed at 1.5 ms. To change
the air gap length, a thin plate of 1.0 mm was added between stator
and engine block.
2.3. Experimental results
2.3.1. The effects of input caloric value
Input caloric value (kJ/s) is calculated by multiplication
between mass flow rate (kg/s) and lower heating value (LHV) of
the fuel (kJ/kg). The input caloric value is varied at 4.56, 5.21,
5.88, 6.53 kJ/s, while the equivalence ratio, spark timing delay
and air gap length are fixed at 1.0, 1.5 ms and 2.0 mm, respectively.
In order to provide more information for this study, the electrical
resistance is varied from 5 X to 40 X with increment of 5 X. The
effects of input caloric value on the piston velocity and stroke are
shown in Fig. 5. It can be found that the maximum piston velocity
at the input caloric value of 5.88 kJ/s is higher than that of others.
In addition, the largest piston stroke is also found at the input calo-
ric value of 5.88 kJ/s. This implies that the compression ratio of the
linear engine obtains a highest value when the input caloric is
adjusted to 5.88 kJ/s.

power, indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and piston

frequency. This figure shows that most of the generating power,
IMEP and piston frequency at input caloric value of 5.88 kJ/s are
higher than that of others. This is because the piston velocity is
increased, which can be observed in Fig. 5. In Fig. 6, the highest
generating power is found at the input caloric value of 5.88 kJ/s
and electrical resistance of 20 X, with the value of 90.5 W. By
increasing the electrical resistance from 20 X to 40 X, the generat-
ing power has a reduced tendency. To explain this, at first, it is
needed to know that the electrical power output is considered a
multiplication of electromagnetic force with piston velocity [44],
in which the electromagnetic force is considered a resistance force
for the motion of piston. By increasing the electrical resistance
from 20 X to 40 X, the electromagnetic force is decreased [45],
and the decrement of the electromagnetic force is so much faster
than the increment of velocity. As the result, the generating power
has a reduced tendency.
2.3.2. The effects of spark timing delay
In this experiment, the spark timing delay can be adjusted by
ECU. When the translator combined with piston is reciprocated, a
5 V signal is generated immediately after a thin plate stuck on
the translator is detected by the photo sensors. This signal is sent
to ECU to define the spark timing delay. The spark timing is
delayed from 0.5 to 2.0 ms with the increment of 0.5 ms by using
Matlab/Simulink.
Fig. 7 shows the effects of spark timing delay on the piston
velocity and stroke. Therein, the larger piston strokes are found
at the spark timing of 1.0 ms and 1.5 ms, while the maximum
velocity of piston is found at spark timing of 1.5 ms.
The effects of spark timing delay on the maximum
piston stroke, in-cylinder pressure, piston frequency and generat-
ing power are shown in Fig. 8. This figure shows that the
generating power obtains a maximum value of 94 W when the
spark timing delay is 1.5 ms. This is because the maximum velocity
as well as frequency of the piston at the spark timing of 1.5 ms is
higher than that of others. Besides, it can be seen that the maxi-
mum in-cylinder pressure has an increased tendency as the spark
timing is delayed from 0.5 ms to 1.5 ms. However, the maximum
in-cylinder pressure as well as piston stroke is reduced as the spark
timing is delayed to 2.0 ms. This is because the combustion of air/
fuel mixture at spark timing delay 2.0 ms is almost occurred in
expansion process. As the result, the maximum in-cylinder pres-
sure and piston stroke at spark timing delay 2.0 ms are decreased,
as shown in Fig. 8.
2.3.3. The effects of equivalence ratio
In order to vary the equivalence ratio, the air flow rate is fixed at
90.0Lpm, while the input caloric value is varied at 4.70, 5.29, 5.88,
6.46, 7.05 kJ/s, respectively. Therefore, the equivalence ratio is
varied from 0.8 to 1.2 with the increment of 0.1. The electrical
resistance, air gap length and the spark timing delay are fixed at
30 X, 1.0 mm and 1.5 ms, respectively.
Fig. 9 shows relation between piston velocity and stroke under
the effect of equivalence ratio. This figure shows that the piston
velocity and stroke is largest as the equivalence ratio is adjusted
to / = 1.0.
Fig. 10 shows the effect of equivalence ratio on the maximum
piston stroke, in-cylinder pressure, piston frequency and generat-
ing power. It can be seen that the generating power is increased
as the equivalence ratio is adjusted from 0.8 to 1.0. However, the
generating power is decreased when the equivalence ratio is
higher than 1.0. This is occurred as a result of decreasing piston
velocity as well as frequency when the equivalence ratio is
increased from 1.0 to 1.2, as shown in Figs. 9 and 10. In Fig. 10,
the in-cylinder pressure obtains a peak value at equivalence ratio
/ = 1.0. This is because the piston stroke as well as compression

ratio of the linear engine is increased as the equivalence ratio is
adjusted to / = 1.0.
2.3.4. The effects of air gap length
The experiment is performed to investigate the generating
power of the linear engine under the effects of air gap length,
which is varied at 1.0 mm and 2.0 mm.
In order to provide more information for this study, the
electrical resistance is varied at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 40 X.
The equivalence ratio, input caloric value are fixed at 1.0 and
5.88 kJ/s, respectively, while the ignition timing delay is fixed at
1.5 ms. The generating voltage and current were measured by
varying the electrical resistance from 5 X to 40 X at each condition
of the air gap length.
As can be seen in Fig. 11, the generating power is increased as
the air gap length is decreased from 2.0 mm to 1.0 mm at each
condition of electrical resistance. This is also appropriate with
results obtained in previous study [32]. The highest generating
power is obtained at the air gap length of 1.0 mm and the electrical
resistance of 30 X.
Summarily, the maximum generating power is 111 W when the
experimental conditions are that the air gap length, electrical
resistance, equivalence ratio and spark timing delay are 1.0 mm,
30 X, 1.0 and 1.5 ms, respectively.
2.3.5. Durable test of the linear engine
The durable test was defined as the sum of all the experiments
at the same experiment conditions. In the durable test, the linear

750 O. Lim et al. / Applied Energy 160 (2015) 746–760
engine was operated continuously during one test. Fig. 12 shows a
graph of running time and total running time during 40 days. The
results of durable test are shown in Fig. 13. It can be seen that there
are no problems for the linear engine after about one hundred
hours of the durable test.
3. Simulation study
The operating model of the FPLE is shown in Fig. 14. Therein, the
FPLE is the combination of two main components including a free
piston engine and a flat-type linear generator, which are described
in Figs. 3 and 4. The geometric parameters of the free piston engine
are shown in Fig. 15. Table 2 shows the specifications and operat-
ing conditions of the linear engine.
Based on the operating model of FPLE, a combination of three
mathematical models including a dynamic model, a linear alternator
model and a thermodynamic model is established. The dynamic
model included an analysis of the piston motion, based on Newton’s
second law. The linear alternator model included an analysis of elec-
tromagnetic force, which was considered to be a resistance force for
the piston motion. The thermodynamic model was used to analysis
thermodynamic processes in the engine cycle, including scavenging,
compression, combustion, and expansion processes. Therein, the
scavenging process was assumed to be a perfect process.
3.1. Piston dynamic model
The forces applied on the FPLE are expressed through a free
body diagram as shown in Fig. 16. For the free piston engine, the
dual piston is affected by forces generating from the pressure in
the left and right cylinders. The motion of the dual piston is also
affected by metal spring installed in each cylinder of the compres-
sor. The metal spring is always compressed during the motion of
the dual piston. Therefore, it produces elastic forces described in
Fig. 16. For the linear alternator, electromagnetic force generated
in air gap between stator and translator is considered as a resis-
tance force for the piston motion. In Fig. 16, the moving mass
including dual piston, connecting system, permanent magnet is
assumed to move from left side to right side, the electromagnetic
force and friction force have an opposite direction. The motion of
the piston obeys Newton’s second law, and the piston acceleration
is determined by:

where F = (Pl-P r )A, F f is friction force, Fe is electromagnetic force, F sl
and Fsr are the spring force to the left and right, respectively. These
spring forces are calculated by equations:

F sr ¼ kDx r ð3Þ
3.2. Linear generator model
Based on the structure of linear generator described in Fig. 4, a
single-phase linear generator model with a permanent magnet is
built, as shown in Fig. 17 [46].
In Fig. 17, a magneto motive force (MMF) in the air gap is gen-
erated by the permanent magnet mounted on the translator. Based
on the description in Fig. 17, the MMF can be obtained as:

3.4. Simulation results
3.4.1. Validation between simulation and experiment
The simulation results compared with experimental data
include in-cylinder pressure, velocity of piston and electric power
output, which are the most typical parameters of the numerical
models. Therein, the simulation results are compared with experi-
mental data in the same initial conditions as shown in Table 2.
The simulation and experimental results for in-cylinder pres-
sure and volume are shown in Fig. 19. It can be seen that there
are no significant differences between the simulated pressure
curves and experimental pressure curves. Fig. 20 shows the simu-
lation and experimental results for piston velocity and displace-
ment. This figure shows that the simulated velocity curves and
experimental velocity curves are closely similar. The simulation
and experimental results for electric power output are shown
Table 3. It can be seen that the simulation results and experimental
data for electrical power output are not considerably different
when the load resistance is changed from RL = 30 X to RL = 40 X.

3.4.2. The effects of key parameters on the electric power output of the
FPLE
3.4.2.1. The effects of reciprocating mass. One of key parameters
affecting directly to piston motion is reciprocating mass which
includes dual piston, connecting rod and permanent magnet. By
changing reciprocating mass, the inertial force will be changed
and it affects to piston stroke as well as compression ratio of the
linear engine. In this study, the reciprocating mass is changed at
0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0 kg, while the other conditions are retain con-
stant as shown in Table 2.
The effects of reciprocating mass to the electric power output,
maximum piston displacement and velocity are shown in Fig. 21.
It can be seen that the maximum piston velocity is reduced signif-
icantly with the decrement of 14.5%, while the maximum piston
displacement is increased only 1.2% as the reciprocating mass is
increased from 0.7 kg to 1.0 kg. This is because the inertial force
is increased when increasing the reciprocating mass. Besides, by
increasing reciprocating mass, the electric power output is reduced
around 27.2%. The decrease of maximum piston velocity is consid-
ered one of causes of this phenomenon [44].
3.4.2.2. The effects of spark timing. In the conventional engines with
a crankshaft mechanism, the spark timing is determined by a crank
angle. For the free piston linear engine, the crankshaft is not
included, the spark timing is determined by a piston position in
cylinder, where a spark ignition is occurred controlled by ECU. To
investigate the effects of spark timing to the piston dynamics
and electric power output of the linear engine, the spark timing
is changed at 8, 7, 6, and 5 mm, while the other conditions are kept
constant as shown in Table 2.
The effects of spark timing to the piston dynamics and electric
power output of the linear engine are shown in Fig. 22. This figure
shows that the maximum piston velocity and displacement are
increased about 18.8% and 17.5% respectively when the spark tim-
ing is adjusted from xig = 8 mm to xig = 5 mm. This is explained that
when the spark timing is adjusted toward the cylinder head, the
heat release after top dead center (TDC) is increased. As the result,
the maximum piston velocity and displacement is increased.
The increase of the piston velocity leads to increasing of the
electric power output as shown in Fig. 22. Namely, when the spark
timing is adjusted from xig = 8 mm to xig = 5 mm, the electric power
output is increased about 22.4%.
3.4.2.3. The effects of spring stiffness. In this study, a metal spring is
installed in each cylinder of the compressor. The objective of this
work is to prevent a collision between piston crown and cylinder
head. Besides, the metal spring can store mechanical energy in
compression stroke and release mechanical energy in expansion
stroke of the piston in cylinder. The change of spring stiffness
affects directly on storing and releasing the mechanical energy,
and it also affects to piston stroke as well as compression ratio of
the linear engine. In this study, the spring stiffness is changed at
0.5, 1, 2.9, and 14.7 N/mm, while the other operating conditions
are kept constant as shown in Table 2.
Fig. 23 describes the effects of spring stiffness to the piston
dynamics and electric power output of the linear engine. This fig-
ure shows that the maximum piston velocity is increased consider-
ably with the increment of 27.9%, while the maximum piston
displacement only increases about 1.9%. This is explained that
when the spring stiffness is increased, the thrust force is increased
leading to increasing of piston velocity, however, it also causes a
high resistance force due to dual piston structure, and this explains

why the piston displacement is increased slightly. As can be seen in
Fig. 23, the electric power is increased about 30.8% when increas-
ing spring stiffness from k = 0.5 N/mm to k = 14.7 N/mm. This is
explained by increasing of piston velocity as the spring stiffness
is increased, as shown in Fig. 23. Fig. 24 shows the effects of spring
stiffness and reciprocating mass to thermal efficiency of the linear
engine. In this figure, the spring stiffness and reciprocating mass
are varied with values mentioned, while the spark timing is
retained at xig = 5 mm. This result shows that the thermal effi-
ciency is increased significantly if the reciprocating mass is
increased at each value of spring stiffness. Meanwhile, by changing
spring stiffness shown in Fig. 24, the thermal efficiency is slightly
varied.
3.4.2.4. Optimization of electric power output. A study is conducted
to optimized the electric power output based on the simulation
results as mentioned above. In this study, the effects of reciprocat-
ing mass and spark timing on the electric power output are
investigated first, while the spring stiffness is kept constant
k = 2.9 N/mm. Therein, spark timing is changed from xig = 5 mm
to xig = 8 mm, while reciprocating mass is changed from
m = 0.7 kg to m = 1 kg. The objective of this work is to find out
the highest value of electric power output corresponding to one
value of reciprocating mass and spark timing.
Fig. 25 shows a graph of the electric power output versus
reciprocating mass and spark timing. The simulation results show
that the electric power output is increased as the spark timing is
adjusted from xig = 8 mm to xig = 5 mm for each value of reciprocat-
ing mass. When the reciprocating mass is reduced from m = 1.0 kg
to m = 0.7 kg, the electric power output is increased for each value
of spark timing. This is explained by increasing of maximum piston
velocity caused by reducing reciprocating mass, as shown in
Fig. 21. As can be seen in Fig. 25, the highest electric power output
is found with the value of 128.2 W as the spark timing and recip-
rocating mass are xig = 5 mm and m = 0.7 kg, respectively. The elec-
tric power output is increased about 27.2% as reciprocating mass is
reduced from m = 1.0 kg to m = 0.7 kg, while the spark timing is
kept constant xig = 5 mm.
As can be seen in Fig. 25, the highest electric power output of
the FPLE is found at spark timing xig = 5 mm. Hence, the spark tim-
ing xig = 5 mm is retained constant in investigating the effects of
reciprocating mass and spring stiffness to the electric power out-
put of the linear engine. Fig. 26 shows a graph of the electric power
output versus reciprocating mass and spring stiffness. The simula-
tion results show that, at each value of reciprocating mass, the
electric power output is increased considerably when increasing
spring stiffness from k = 0.5 N/mm to k = 14.7 N/mm. For instance,
the electric power output is increased about 30.8% as the spring
stiffness is increased from k = 0.5 N/mm to k = 14.7 N/mm at the
same reciprocating mass m = 0.8 kg. This is because the maximum
piston velocity is increased as described in Fig. 23. Fig. 26 shows
that, at each constant value of spring stiffness, the electric power

output is also increased when decreasing reciprocating mass. As
can be seen in Fig. 26, the maximum electric power output is found
at spring stiffness and reciprocating mass are k = 14.7 N/mm and
m = 0.7 kg, respectively. Based on the analysis presented above,
the optimized value of electric power output (Pe = 188 W) is found
at spark timing xig = 5 mm, reciprocating mass m = 0.7 kg, and
spring stiffness k = 14.7 N/mm.
In order to evaluate amount of thermal energy converted to
electric energy, a study of energy conversion efficiency between
thermal energy and electric energy also needs to be examined. In

this study, the energy conversion efficiency (gc) is calculated by a
ratio between electric power output (Pe) and indicated power
(Pi), gc = Pe/Pi. Fig. 27 shows the effects of reciprocating mass and
spark timing on the energy conversion efficiency. This figure shows
that the linear engine get a benefit of the energy conversion effi-
ciency as the reciprocating mass is reduced, while the change of
spark timing has no significant effect to the energy conversion effi-
ciency at the same reciprocating mass. Fig. 28 shows the effects of
reciprocating mass and spring stiffness on the energy conversion
efficiency. It can be seen that, both reciprocating mass and spring
stiffness affect considerably to the energy conversion efficiency.
As can be seen in Fig. 28, the maximum energy conversion
efficiency is found at reciprocating mass m = 0.7 kg and spring
stiffness k = 14.7 N/mm.
4. Conclusion
As a main part of this study, an experiment on the linear engine
has been conducted. The linear engine performance test was con-
ducted by changing the main parameters such as input caloric
value, spark timing delay, equivalence ratio, electrical resistance
and air gap length. The experimental results indicated that the
electrical resistance has a negative effect on the generating power
if it over one certain value. The maximum generating power was
found with the value of 111 W at the input caloric value, spark tim-
ing delay, equivalence ratio, electrical resistance and air gap length
were 5.88 kJ/s, 1.5 ms, 1.0, 30 X and 1.0 mm, respectively. A dur-
able test was conducted to observe the behavior of the linear
engine after about 100 h of the durable test. The experimental
results showed that there were no problems for the linear engine
after about one hundred hours of the durable test. Beside the
experimental study, a simulation study has been conducted based
on the combination of three mathematical models. By using these
mathematical models, the simulation results including piston
velocity, in-cylinder pressure and electric power output were
nearly similar to experimental data. Besides, the effects of key
parameters such as reciprocating mass, spark timing and spring
stiffness on the piston dynamics and electric power output of the
linear engine were also investigated. The simulation results
showed that a highest generating power of the linear engine could
be easily found by optimizing the key parameters. The optimized
generating power was Pe = 188 W, which corresponded to spark
timing xig = 5 mm, reciprocating mass m = 0.7 kg, and spring stiff-
ness k = 14.7 N/mm.
Current work mainly focused on the generating power and find-
ing the suitable conditions to optimize the generating power of the
free-piston linear engine. The next stage is to investigate further
the piston dynamics and combustion characteristics of the linear
engine in spark ignition mode and advanced ignition mode (homo-
geneous charge compression ignition mode). Furthermore, the
various fuels will be used in the linear engine such as diesel,
DME and hydrogen et al.
