  "original_abstract": "3D sand mould printing using binder jet technology can enable many technical improvements in casting practice, including part consolidation, design of parts to\noptimise the consumption of materials and hazardous chemicals, and on-demand and flexible size part manufacturing near the customer. Incorporating artificial\nintelligence in optimising the design of moulds, printing process parameters, and solidification processes may help automate a production facility and reduce labour\ntime. Elimination of hazardous chemicals from industrial use may be a challenge. Therefore, an alternative technology to fuse the sand particles during printing or an\nenvironmentally friendlier alternative option for the binders and other consumables should be utilised with the 3D sand printing process. Properties of parts produced\nusing 3D printed sand moulds have the potential to be better than the properties of parts produced using traditional casting due to this technology’s benefits. This\ntechnology is an enabling technology for traditional casting processes rather than a competing technology. It is causing a paradigm shift in casting design because of\nthe mould geometries achievable by using additive manufacturing to produce the sand mould. This paper reviews the first twenty years of research and challenges in\ndeveloping 3D sand printing processes as an innovation for sustainable manufacturing.",

  "corrected_abstract": "3D sand mould printing using binder jet technology has enabled significant advances in casting practice over the past two decades. This technology facilitates part consolidation, material usage optimization, and the reduction of hazardous chemicals, while allowing on-demand, flexible production closer to customers. The integration of artificial intelligence can further improve mould design, optimize process parameters, and automate production, thus reducing labour requirements. Despite its advantages, the elimination of environmentally harmful chemicals remains a challenge; ongoing research aims to develop alternative binders and fusion technologies to mitigate these issues. Substantial improvements in part properties have been achieved compared to traditional casting methods, illustrating that 3D sand printing is a complementary enabling innovation rather than a competing approach. The expanded mould design possibilities offered by additive manufacturing have driven a paradigm shift in casting design. This review summarizes key developments, research trends, and remaining challenges in the evolution of 3D sand printing processes for sustainable manufacturing.",
