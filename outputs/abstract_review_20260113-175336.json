  "original_abstract": "The design of biomaterial scaffolds for bone regeneration has traditionally focused on optimizing static properties like porosity and mechanical strength, largely disregarding the dynamic, multi-phase nature of the healing process. Here, we introduce the concept of architectural programming—the deliberate engineering of a scaffold's pore network to control the kinetics of mass transport and degradation, thereby aligning its function with the temporal progression of healing. Using a solvent-cast poly(L-lactic acid)/poly(ε-caprolactone) (PLLA/PCL) base, we created two distinct architectures: a 40 wt% Klucel formulation exhibiting \"democratic porosity\" (high specific surface area of 15.46 m²/g; low closed porosity of 8.8%) and a 20 wt% PVA formulation with \"programmed latency\" (high closed porosity of 21.5%; superior intrinsic permeability of 3.17×10⁻⁵). These architectural differences yielded a 289-fold greater acidic flux in the Klucel scaffold, functioning as a built-in \"exhaust fan\" to clear cytotoxic degradation byproducts. Kinetic modeling confirmed staged functionality: Klucel exhibited rapid, Fickian release and swelling (24 h), while PVA showed anomalous, erosion-coupled release and gradual hydration (72 h). Crucially, we identify a determinative architecture-additive interaction: the Klucel scaffold's high-flux network is catastrophically clogged by hydroxyapatite particles, reducing cell viability to ~20%, whereas the PVA scaffold maintains biocompatibility. This work establishes architectural programming as a new paradigm for designing biomaterials that actively orchestrate the healing timeline, with broad implications for regenerative medicine.",

  "corrected_abstract": "The design of biomaterial scaffolds for bone regeneration has historically emphasized static properties such as porosity and mechanical strength, often neglecting the dynamic, multi-stage nature of the healing process. In this study, we present the concept of architectural programming—a strategy involving the deliberate engineering of a scaffold’s internal pore network to regulate the rates of mass transport and material degradation, thereby synchronizing scaffold function with the temporal sequence of tissue healing. Using a solvent-cast poly(L-lactic acid)/poly(ε-caprolactone) (PLLA/PCL) matrix, two distinct scaffold architectures were fabricated: a 40 wt% Klucel formulation characterized by high “democratic porosity” (defined herein as a specific surface area of 15.46 m²/g and low closed porosity, 8.8%) and a 20 wt% poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) formulation exhibiting “programmed latency” (defined by high closed porosity at 21.5% and intrinsic permeability of 3.17 × 10⁻⁵ cm²). These architectural distinctions produced markedly different functional profiles; specifically, the Klucel-based scaffold exhibited a 289-fold greater acidic flux (relative to PVA), facilitating rapid clearance of acidic degradation byproducts. Kinetic release modeling revealed that the Klucel scaffold supported rapid, diffusion-driven (Fickian) release and swelling within 24 hours, whereas the PVA scaffold exhibited sustained, erosion-coupled release and gradual hydration over 72 hours. Furthermore, the presence of hydroxyapatite particles was found to obstruct the high-permeability network of the Klucel scaffold, reducing cell viability to approximately 20%, while the PVA scaffold retained biocompatibility. Architectural programming thus establishes a framework for designing biomaterials whose functional properties adapt to the evolving phases of tissue healing. This approach holds significant potential for a wide range of regenerative medicine applications, including the engineering and repair of complex tissue interfaces where precise temporal coordination of scaffold performance is critical .\n---\n**Citations:**",
