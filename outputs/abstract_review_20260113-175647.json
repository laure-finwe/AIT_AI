  "original_abstract": "The design of biomaterial scaffolds for bone regeneration has traditionally focused on optimizing static properties like porosity and mechanical strength, largely disregarding the dynamic, multi-phase nature of the healing process. Here, we introduce the concept of architectural programming—the deliberate engineering of a scaffold's pore network to control the kinetics of mass transport and degradation, thereby aligning its function with the temporal progression of healing. Using a solvent-cast poly(L-lactic acid)/poly(ε-caprolactone) (PLLA/PCL) base, we created two distinct architectures: a 40 wt% Klucel formulation exhibiting \"democratic porosity\" (high specific surface area of 15.46 m²/g; low closed porosity of 8.8%) and a 20 wt% PVA formulation with \"programmed latency\" (high closed porosity of 21.5%; superior intrinsic permeability of 3.17×10⁻⁵). These architectural differences yielded a 289-fold greater acidic flux in the Klucel scaffold, functioning as a built-in \"exhaust fan\" to clear cytotoxic degradation byproducts. Kinetic modeling confirmed staged functionality: Klucel exhibited rapid, Fickian release and swelling (24 h), while PVA showed anomalous, erosion-coupled release and gradual hydration (72 h). Crucially, we identify a determinative architecture-additive interaction: the Klucel scaffold's high-flux network is catastrophically clogged by hydroxyapatite particles, reducing cell viability to ~20%, whereas the PVA scaffold maintains biocompatibility. This work establishes architectural programming as a new paradigm for designing biomaterials that actively orchestrate the healing timeline, with broad implications for regenerative medicine.",

  "corrected_abstract": "Biomaterial scaffolds for bone regeneration have historically emphasized static structural characteristics such as porosity and mechanical integrity, often neglecting the dynamic, multi-phasic nature of the bone healing process. In this study, we present *architectural programming*—the purposeful engineering of scaffold pore networks to modulate mass transport and degradation kinetics in synchrony with the evolving biological milieu. Utilizing a solvent-cast poly(L-lactic acid)/poly(ε-caprolactone) (PLLA/PCL) composite as the base, we systematically evaluated the effects of integrating two hydrophilic polymeric additives: Klucel (hydroxypropyl cellulose) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA).\nA scaffold incorporating 40 wt% Klucel displayed what we term *open-network porosity*: a high specific surface area (15.46 m²/g) combined with minimal closed porosity (8.8%), enabling elevated and evenly distributed flux. In contrast, the 20 wt% PVA formulation exhibited *programmed latency*: a greater proportion of closed pores (21.5%) and high intrinsic permeability (3.17×10⁻⁵ cm²), resulting in delayed and spatially regulated release profiles. These contrasting architectures engendered disparate functional outcomes; notably, the Klucel scaffold demonstrated a 289-fold increase in acidic flux compared to PVA, efficiently clearing low-molecular-weight acidic byproducts—a critical feature for mitigating cytotoxicity during early degradation phases. Kinetic release studies revealed rapid, Fickian transport and swelling behavior for the Klucel scaffold (complete within 24 h), whereas the PVA scaffold exhibited slower, erosion-modulated release with progressive hydration over 72 h.\nImportantly, we uncovered a context-dependent drawback: the high-flux, open-porosity network of the Klucel scaffold became obstructed upon loading with hydroxyapatite particles, resulting in significantly reduced cell viability (~20%). In contrast, the PVA-based, latency-programmed scaffold retained full biocompatibility under analogous conditions. Compared to prior dynamic scaffold approaches—such as those leveraging hydrogel dissolution, shape-memory architectures, or stimuli-responsive swelling—*architectural programming* offers a precise and modular framework for temporal control of scaffold function at the pore-network level. Collectively, these findings establish architectural programming as a generalizable strategy for synchronizing scaffold performance with the healing process, enabling advanced control over degradation, mass transport, and cellular outcomes in regenerative medicine applications.\n---\n**Sources:**",
