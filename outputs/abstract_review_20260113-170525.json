  "corrected_abstract": "This paper presents an experimental and simulation study of a free piston linear engine system designed for electric power generation. The proposed system comprises a two-stroke free piston engine integrated with linear generators and compressors, enabling direct conversion of reciprocating motion into electrical energy. The research focuses on analyzing the engine’s structural design, operating conditions, and performance under varying load scenarios. Experimental investigations were conducted to evaluate the efficiency, stability, and output characteristics of the linear engine, while simulation models were used to investigate dynamic behavior and optimize key parameters. Results indicate that the integrated linear generator operates efficiently over a wide range of pressures and frequencies, with stable power output and minimal mechanical losses. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of free piston linear engines as effective solutions for compact, flexible, and high-efficiency electric power generation systems. The study provides valuable insights into the design and operational optimization of such engines for future applications in distributed energy systems.",
