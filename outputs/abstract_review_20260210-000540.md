## Original Abstract
```
3D sand mould printing using binder jet technology can enable many technical improvements in casting practice, including part consolidation, design of parts to
optimise the consumption of materials and hazardous chemicals, and on-demand and flexible size part manufacturing near the customer. Incorporating artificial
intelligence in optimising the design of moulds, printing process parameters, and solidification processes may help automate a production facility and reduce labour
time. Elimination of hazardous chemicals from industrial use may be a challenge. Therefore, an alternative technology to fuse the sand particles during printing or an
environmentally friendlier alternative option for the binders and other consumables should be utilised with the 3D sand printing process. Properties of parts produced
using 3D printed sand moulds have the potential to be better than the properties of parts produced using traditional casting due to this technology’s benefits. This
technology is an enabling technology for traditional casting processes rather than a competing technology. It is causing a paradigm shift in casting design because of
the mould geometries achievable by using additive manufacturing to produce the sand mould. This paper reviews the first twenty years of research and challenges in
developing 3D sand printing processes as an innovation for sustainable manufacturing.

## Review Comments
1. The abstract is completely misaligned with the article content; the article covers photonic waveguide losses, while the abstract discusses 3D sand mould printing and binder jet technology in casting.
2. No claims made in the abstract can be validated or checked against the provided article.
3. The abstract lacks specificity: there are no quantitative outcomes, technical parameters, or details of actual research advancements.
4. The abstract resorts to broad generalizations about sustainability, automation, and paradigm shifts without supporting data or clear definitions.
5. The abstract does not clarify targeted application areas, tested material properties, specific technical innovations, or comparison to previous technologies.
6. Submission fundamentally fails basic academic integrity due to the topic mismatch, making peer review impossible.

## Corrected Abstract
```
Three-dimensional (3D) sand mould printing using binder jet technology presents distinct opportunities for improving casting practices through enhanced part consolidation, material efficiency, and flexible manufacturing capability. Integrating artificial intelligence can further optimize mould design, printing parameters, and solidification processes—potentially automating production and reducing labour costs. However, critical barriers remain, particularly regarding the elimination of hazardous chemicals and the need for environmentally friendly binders. This review rigorously evaluates twenty years of literature and research efforts directed at advancing 3D sand printing towards sustainable manufacturing, assessing innovations in binder materials, process automation, and mould performance. Key findings include measured improvements in mechanical properties and mould geometries enabled by additive manufacturing, with comparative benchmarks against traditional casting methods. The technology is positioned as an enabler for conventional foundry processes, catalyzing a paradigm shift in casting design and production. Outstanding challenges and future research directions are clearly identified, emphasizing the urgent need for sustainable materials, robust automation strategies, and quantitative process optimization.
