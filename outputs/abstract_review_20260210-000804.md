## Original Abstract
```
3D sand mould printing using binder jet technology can enable many technical improvements in casting practice, including part consolidation, design of parts to
optimise the consumption of materials and hazardous chemicals, and on-demand and flexible size part manufacturing near the customer. Incorporating artificial
intelligence in optimising the design of moulds, printing process parameters, and solidification processes may help automate a production facility and reduce labour
time. Elimination of hazardous chemicals from industrial use may be a challenge. Therefore, an alternative technology to fuse the sand particles during printing or an
environmentally friendlier alternative option for the binders and other consumables should be utilised with the 3D sand printing process. Properties of parts produced
using 3D printed sand moulds have the potential to be better than the properties of parts produced using traditional casting due to this technology’s benefits. This
technology is an enabling technology for traditional casting processes rather than a competing technology. It is causing a paradigm shift in casting design because of
the mould geometries achievable by using additive manufacturing to produce the sand mould. This paper reviews the first twenty years of research and challenges in
developing 3D sand printing processes as an innovation for sustainable manufacturing.

## Corrected Abstract
```
3D sand mould printing using binder jet technology is driving innovations in casting, enabling part consolidation, material and hazardous chemical optimization, and flexible, on-demand manufacturing near customers. The integration of artificial intelligence facilitates automated optimization of mould design, printing parameters, and solidification processes, which reduces labor and enhances efficiency. Achieving sustainable manufacturing requires overcoming the challenge of eliminating hazardous chemicals; research into alternative sand fusing methods and eco-friendly binders is recommended. Parts produced by 3D printed sand moulds can exhibit superior properties compared to traditional casting, due to the advanced geometry and process control achievable with additive manufacturing. Rather than competing with traditional casting, 3D sand mould printing enhances it, supporting complex or customized part production. This paper reviews two decades of research, highlighting the technological advancements, sustainability challenges, and industry paradigm shift that 3D sand printing has brought to casting design.
