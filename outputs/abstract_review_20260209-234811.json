  "original_abstract": "3D sand mould printing using binder jet technology can enable many technical improvements in casting practice, including part consolidation, design of parts to\noptimise the consumption of materials and hazardous chemicals, and on-demand and flexible size part manufacturing near the customer. Incorporating artificial\nintelligence in optimising the design of moulds, printing process parameters, and solidification processes may help automate a production facility and reduce labour\ntime. Elimination of hazardous chemicals from industrial use may be a challenge. Therefore, an alternative technology to fuse the sand particles during printing or an\nenvironmentally friendlier alternative option for the binders and other consumables should be utilised with the 3D sand printing process. Properties of parts produced\nusing 3D printed sand moulds have the potential to be better than the properties of parts produced using traditional casting due to this technology’s benefits. This\ntechnology is an enabling technology for traditional casting processes rather than a competing technology. It is causing a paradigm shift in casting design because of\nthe mould geometries achievable by using additive manufacturing to produce the sand mould. This paper reviews the first twenty years of research and challenges in\ndeveloping 3D sand printing processes as an innovation for sustainable manufacturing.",

  "corrected_abstract": "3D sand mould printing using binder jet technology has brought significant advancements to casting practices by enabling part consolidation, optimized material and chemical usage, and flexible manufacturing close to customers. The integration of artificial intelligence in mould design, process parameter optimization, and solidification automation further streamlines production and reduces labor requirements. Addressing environmental concerns—such as the elimination of hazardous chemicals—remains a challenge, necessitating the adoption of alternative methods for sand particle fusion and the use of environmentally friendly binders. Research over the past two decades demonstrates that castings produced from 3D printed sand moulds frequently exhibit improved material properties compared to traditional methods, owing to enhanced mould geometries enabled by additive manufacturing. Rather than competing with conventional casting, 3D sand printing serves as a transformative technology, driving a paradigm shift toward more sustainable manufacturing. This paper reviews key progress and challenges from the first twenty years of 3D sand mould printing research, providing insights into its role as an enabler of sustainable practices in the casting industry.",
  "improvement_summary": "Clearer statement of the abstract’s scope and the paper’s purpose. Explicit mention of research findings regarding enhanced material properties. Stronger and more direct conclusion highlighting sustainability and transformation in the casting field. Greater clarity in how artificial intelligence is integrated and the environmental challenges addressed. Improved language for academic and professional readability.",
