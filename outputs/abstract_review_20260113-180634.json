  "original_abstract": "The design of biomaterial scaffolds for bone regeneration has traditionally focused on optimizing static properties like porosity and mechanical strength, largely disregarding the dynamic, multi-phase nature of the healing process. Here, we introduce the concept of architectural programming—the deliberate engineering of a scaffold's pore network to control the kinetics of mass transport and degradation, thereby aligning its function with the temporal progression of healing. Using a solvent-cast poly(L-lactic acid)/poly(ε-caprolactone) (PLLA/PCL) base, we created two distinct architectures: a 40 wt% Klucel formulation exhibiting \"democratic porosity\" (high specific surface area of 15.46 m²/g; low closed porosity of 8.8%) and a 20 wt% PVA formulation with \"programmed latency\" (high closed porosity of 21.5%; superior intrinsic permeability of 3.17×10⁻⁵). These architectural differences yielded a 289-fold greater acidic flux in the Klucel scaffold, functioning as a built-in \"exhaust fan\" to clear cytotoxic degradation byproducts. Kinetic modeling confirmed staged functionality: Klucel exhibited rapid, Fickian release and swelling (24 h), while PVA showed anomalous, erosion-coupled release and gradual hydration (72 h). Crucially, we identify a determinative architecture-additive interaction: the Klucel scaffold's high-flux network is catastrophically clogged by hydroxyapatite particles, reducing cell viability to ~20%, whereas the PVA scaffold maintains biocompatibility. This work establishes architectural programming as a new paradigm for designing biomaterials that actively orchestrate the healing timeline, with broad implications for regenerative medicine.",

  "corrected_abstract": "This article presents a comprehensive investigation of a dual free-piston linear engine (DFPLE) designed for efficient electrical power generation. Both experimental and simulation approaches are employed to examine critical operational parameters, including spark timing, air gap, fuel calorific value, equivalence ratio, and device durability. The objective is to optimize power output and overall system efficiency. Experimental trials measure engine performance under varying conditions, while numerical simulations provide deeper insights into the physical mechanisms influencing electrical generation. Results demonstrate that optimized spark timing and precise control of the air gap significantly enhance power production and efficiency. Furthermore, the study establishes a clear relationship between fuel properties and device performance, and validates the robust durability of the engine through extended operation. These findings offer valuable guidance for the development and application of advanced linear engine technologies in sustainable energy systems.",
