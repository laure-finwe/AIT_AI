Over the past decades, remarkable progress has been made in reducing the loss of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) within the telecom band1,2,3,4, facilitating on-chip applications spanning low-noise optical5 and microwave synthesis6, to lidar7 and photonic artificial intelligence engines8. However, several obstacles arise from the marked increase in material absorption and scattering losses at shorter wavelengths9,10, which prominently elevate power requirements and limit performance in the visible and near-visible spectrum. Here we present an ultralow-loss PIC platform based on germano-silicate—the material underlying the extraordinary performance of optical fibre—but realized by a fully CMOS-foundry-compatible process. These PICs achieve resonator Q factors surpassing 180 million from violet to telecom wavelengths. They also attain a 10-dB higher quality factor without thermal treatment in the telecom band, expanding opportunities for heterogeneous integration with active components11. Other features of this platform include readily engineered waveguide dispersion, acoustic mode confinement and large-mode-area-induced thermal stability—each demonstrated by soliton microcomb generation, stimulated Brillouin lasing and low-frequency-noise self-injection locking, respectively. The success of these germano-silicate PICs can ultimately enable fibre-like loss onto a chip, leading to an additional 20-dB improvement in waveguide loss over the current highest performance photonic platforms. Moreover, the performance abilities demonstrated here bridge ultralow-loss PIC technology to optical clocks12, precision navigation systems13 and quantum sensors14.

Over recent decades, significant advances have reduced the optical losses of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) operating in the telecom band, enabling a wide range of on-chip applications including low-noise optical and microwave synthesis, lidar, and photonic artificial intelligence engines. However, at shorter wavelengths, increased material absorption and scattering losses considerably raise power demands and restrict device performance in the visible and near-visible spectrum. In this work, we introduce an ultralow-loss PIC platform based on germano-silicate—a material well known for its role in high-performance optical fibers—fabricated using a fully CMOS-foundry-compatible process. Our devices achieve resonator quality (Q) factors exceeding 180 million across wavelengths from violet to telecom. Notably, in the telecom band, these PICs exhibit a 10 dB higher Q factor without the need for thermal treatment, supporting broader integration with active components. Key features of the platform include tunable waveguide dispersion, strong acoustic mode confinement, and large mode areas for enhanced thermal stability, as demonstrated through soliton microcomb generation, stimulated Brillouin lasing, and low-frequency-noise self-injection locking. Compared to current state-of-the-art PICs, our germano-silicate technology achieves up to a 20 dB improvement in waveguide loss, approaching performance traditionally only possible with optical fiber. With these capabilities, this platform extends ultralow-loss PIC technology to demanding applications such as optical clocks, precision navigation systems, and quantum sensors. These results establish a transformative foundation for integrated photonics, bridging fibre-like performance with on-chip scalability and versatility.
