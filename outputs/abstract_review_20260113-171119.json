  "original_abstract": "The design of biomaterial scaffolds for bone regeneration has traditionally focused on optimizing static properties like porosity and mechanical strength, largely disregarding the dynamic, multi-phase nature of the healing process. Here, we introduce the concept of architectural programming—the deliberate engineering of a scaffold's pore network to control the kinetics of mass transport and degradation, thereby aligning its function with the temporal progression of healing. Using a solvent-cast poly(L-lactic acid)/poly(ε-caprolactone) (PLLA/PCL) base, we created two distinct architectures: a 40 wt% Klucel formulation exhibiting \"democratic porosity\" (high specific surface area of 15.46 m²/g; low closed porosity of 8.8%) and a 20 wt% PVA formulation with \"programmed latency\" (high closed porosity of 21.5%; superior intrinsic permeability of 3.17×10⁻⁵). These architectural differences yielded a 289-fold greater acidic flux in the Klucel scaffold, functioning as a built-in \"exhaust fan\" to clear cytotoxic degradation byproducts. Kinetic modeling confirmed staged functionality: Klucel exhibited rapid, Fickian release and swelling (24 h), while PVA showed anomalous, erosion-coupled release and gradual hydration (72 h). Crucially, we identify a determinative architecture-additive interaction: the Klucel scaffold's high-flux network is catastrophically clogged by hydroxyapatite particles, reducing cell viability to ~20%, whereas the PVA scaffold maintains biocompatibility. This work establishes architectural programming as a new paradigm for designing biomaterials that actively orchestrate the healing timeline, with broad implications for regenerative medicine.",

  "corrected_abstract": "The development of biomaterial scaffolds for bone regeneration has primarily concentrated on static features such as porosity and mechanical strength, often overlooking the dynamic, multi-phase nature of tissue healing. In this study, we present the concept of *architectural programming*: deliberately engineering the internal pore structure of scaffolds to modulate the rates of nutrient transport and material degradation, thereby coordinating scaffold function with specific stages of bone healing. Employing a solvent-cast poly(L-lactic acid)/poly(ε-caprolactone) (PLLA/PCL) scaffold base, we engineered two distinct pore architectures. The first, created with 40 wt% Klucel, generates a highly interconnected open-pore configuration—termed “democratic porosity”—characterized by a high specific surface area (15.46 m²/g) and low fraction of isolated (closed) pores (8.8%). In contrast, the second, using 20 wt% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), exhibits higher closed porosity (21.5%) and enhanced permeability (3.17×10⁻⁵ cm²), resulting in “programmed latency”—deliberately slowed mass transport.\nThese architectural distinctions have biological significance: the democratic porosity scaffold enabled a 289-fold increase in acidic byproduct clearance, mimicking a biological “exhaust fan” to expel cytotoxic degradation acids. Kinetic analysis revealed rapid, diffusion-driven (Fickian) byproduct release in the Klucel scaffold (within 24 hours), and a slower, erosion-mediated release with the PVA scaffold (over 72 hours), aligning each design with different healing phases. Notably, we discovered that the high-flux architecture of the Klucel scaffold becomes severely obstructed when exposed to hydroxyapatite particles—a mineral naturally present during bone healing—causing pore network “clogging” and a reduction of cell viability to approximately 20%. This occurs because hydroxyapatite aggregates within the interconnected pores, blocking transport pathways essential for cell survival. Conversely, the PVA scaffold retained biocompatibility, avoiding this detrimental effect.\nOur findings demonstrate that architectural programming enables scaffold designs that actively coordinate with the evolving physiological environment during bone regeneration. This approach holds significant promise for improving outcomes in regenerative medicine, such as in complex bone defect repair or graft integration, where temporal control over scaffold function is critical. \n---\nIf you require further adjustment (e.g., shortening to fit specific word limits or emphasizing a particular aspect), let me know!",
