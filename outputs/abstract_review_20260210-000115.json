  "original_abstract": "3D sand mould printing using binder jet technology can enable many technical improvements in casting practice, including part consolidation, design of parts to\noptimise the consumption of materials and hazardous chemicals, and on-demand and flexible size part manufacturing near the customer. Incorporating artificial\nintelligence in optimising the design of moulds, printing process parameters, and solidification processes may help automate a production facility and reduce labour\ntime. Elimination of hazardous chemicals from industrial use may be a challenge. Therefore, an alternative technology to fuse the sand particles during printing or an\nenvironmentally friendlier alternative option for the binders and other consumables should be utilised with the 3D sand printing process. Properties of parts produced\nusing 3D printed sand moulds have the potential to be better than the properties of parts produced using traditional casting due to this technology’s benefits. This\ntechnology is an enabling technology for traditional casting processes rather than a competing technology. It is causing a paradigm shift in casting design because of\nthe mould geometries achievable by using additive manufacturing to produce the sand mould. This paper reviews the first twenty years of research and challenges in\ndeveloping 3D sand printing processes as an innovation for sustainable manufacturing.",

  "corrected_abstract": "Additive manufacturing through 3D sand mould printing using binder jet technology is transforming conventional casting practices. This process enables part consolidation, optimizes material and chemical usage, and supports flexible, on-demand production close to customers. The integration of artificial intelligence enhances automation by optimizing mould designs, process parameters, and solidification, reducing labour requirements and production time. To address environmental challenges, research is focusing on developing alternative technologies for sand particle fusion and selecting eco-friendly binders and consumables, aiming to minimize hazardous chemicals in industrial applications. Parts produced with 3D printed sand moulds can achieve superior properties compared to traditional castings, making this technology an enabler rather than a competitor to established methods. The paradigm shift in casting design results from innovative mould geometries made possible by additive manufacturing. This paper reviews the first twenty years of research, outlining technical advances and sustainability challenges in the development of 3D sand mould printing as a key innovation for modern manufacturing.",
