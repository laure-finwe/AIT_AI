## Original Abstract
```
3D sand mould printing using binder jet technology can enable many technical improvements in casting practice, including part consolidation, design of parts to
optimise the consumption of materials and hazardous chemicals, and on-demand and flexible size part manufacturing near the customer. Incorporating artificial
intelligence in optimising the design of moulds, printing process parameters, and solidification processes may help automate a production facility and reduce labour
time. Elimination of hazardous chemicals from industrial use may be a challenge. Therefore, an alternative technology to fuse the sand particles during printing or an
environmentally friendlier alternative option for the binders and other consumables should be utilised with the 3D sand printing process. Properties of parts produced
using 3D printed sand moulds have the potential to be better than the properties of parts produced using traditional casting due to this technology’s benefits. This
technology is an enabling technology for traditional casting processes rather than a competing technology. It is causing a paradigm shift in casting design because of
the mould geometries achievable by using additive manufacturing to produce the sand mould. This paper reviews the first twenty years of research and challenges in
developing 3D sand printing processes as an innovation for sustainable manufacturing.

## Corrected Abstract
```
Three-dimensional sand mould printing with binder jet technology is transforming casting practices by enabling part consolidation, material and hazardous chemical optimization, and flexible, on-demand production close to end users. Integrating artificial intelligence for optimizing mould design, printing parameters, and solidification processes promotes automation and reduces labor requirements. However, phasing out hazardous chemicals in industrial settings remains a challenge. To address this, research is ongoing into alternative binder formulations and sand fusion methods that are more environmentally friendly. Parts produced with 3D-printed sand moulds often exhibit superior properties compared to those made with traditional methods, owing to improved design complexity and process control. Rather than competing with conventional casting, this technology serves as a catalyst for its advancement, enabling new mould geometries and a paradigm shift in casting design. This paper reviews twenty years of progress, key challenges, and future opportunities for 3D sand printing as an innovation for sustainable manufacturing.
