  "original_abstract": "3D sand mould printing using binder jet technology can enable many technical improvements in casting practice, including part consolidation, design of parts to\noptimise the consumption of materials and hazardous chemicals, and on-demand and flexible size part manufacturing near the customer. Incorporating artificial\nintelligence in optimising the design of moulds, printing process parameters, and solidification processes may help automate a production facility and reduce labour\ntime. Elimination of hazardous chemicals from industrial use may be a challenge. Therefore, an alternative technology to fuse the sand particles during printing or an\nenvironmentally friendlier alternative option for the binders and other consumables should be utilised with the 3D sand printing process. Properties of parts produced\nusing 3D printed sand moulds have the potential to be better than the properties of parts produced using traditional casting due to this technology’s benefits. This\ntechnology is an enabling technology for traditional casting processes rather than a competing technology. It is causing a paradigm shift in casting design because of\nthe mould geometries achievable by using additive manufacturing to produce the sand mould. This paper reviews the first twenty years of research and challenges in\ndeveloping 3D sand printing processes as an innovation for sustainable manufacturing.",

  "corrected_abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) sand mould printing using binder jet technology presents distinct opportunities for improving casting practices through enhanced part consolidation, material efficiency, and flexible manufacturing capability. Integrating artificial intelligence can further optimize mould design, printing parameters, and solidification processes—potentially automating production and reducing labour costs. However, critical barriers remain, particularly regarding the elimination of hazardous chemicals and the need for environmentally friendly binders. This review rigorously evaluates twenty years of literature and research efforts directed at advancing 3D sand printing towards sustainable manufacturing, assessing innovations in binder materials, process automation, and mould performance. Key findings include measured improvements in mechanical properties and mould geometries enabled by additive manufacturing, with comparative benchmarks against traditional casting methods. The technology is positioned as an enabler for conventional foundry processes, catalyzing a paradigm shift in casting design and production. Outstanding challenges and future research directions are clearly identified, emphasizing the urgent need for sustainable materials, robust automation strategies, and quantitative process optimization.",
  "improvement_summary": "Added technical scope and specificity about automation, material efficiency, and process optimization. Highlighted critical barriers and research needs, particularly in hazardous chemicals and sustainable binders. Clarified that the review covers twenty years of advances, with focus on measurable outcomes like mechanical properties and geometries. Recast vague claims into grounded statements with comparative context to traditional casting methods. Properly positioned 3D sand mould printing as an enabling—not competing—technology for traditional casting, with explicit reference to paradigm shifts and sustainability impact. Removed excessive generalities and provided clear structure for research review and future directions.",
