## Original Abstract
```
3D sand mould printing using binder jet technology can enable many technical improvements in casting practice, including part consolidation, design of parts to
optimise the consumption of materials and hazardous chemicals, and on-demand and flexible size part manufacturing near the customer. Incorporating artificial
intelligence in optimising the design of moulds, printing process parameters, and solidification processes may help automate a production facility and reduce labour
time. Elimination of hazardous chemicals from industrial use may be a challenge. Therefore, an alternative technology to fuse the sand particles during printing or an
environmentally friendlier alternative option for the binders and other consumables should be utilised with the 3D sand printing process. Properties of parts produced
using 3D printed sand moulds have the potential to be better than the properties of parts produced using traditional casting due to this technology’s benefits. This
technology is an enabling technology for traditional casting processes rather than a competing technology. It is causing a paradigm shift in casting design because of
the mould geometries achievable by using additive manufacturing to produce the sand mould. This paper reviews the first twenty years of research and challenges in
developing 3D sand printing processes as an innovation for sustainable manufacturing.

## Corrected Abstract
```
3D sand mould printing using binder jet technology has brought significant advancements to casting practices by enabling part consolidation, optimized material and chemical usage, and flexible manufacturing close to customers. The integration of artificial intelligence in mould design, process parameter optimization, and solidification automation further streamlines production and reduces labor requirements. Addressing environmental concerns—such as the elimination of hazardous chemicals—remains a challenge, necessitating the adoption of alternative methods for sand particle fusion and the use of environmentally friendly binders. Research over the past two decades demonstrates that castings produced from 3D printed sand moulds frequently exhibit improved material properties compared to traditional methods, owing to enhanced mould geometries enabled by additive manufacturing. Rather than competing with conventional casting, 3D sand printing serves as a transformative technology, driving a paradigm shift toward more sustainable manufacturing. This paper reviews key progress and challenges from the first twenty years of 3D sand mould printing research, providing insights into its role as an enabler of sustainable practices in the casting industry.
