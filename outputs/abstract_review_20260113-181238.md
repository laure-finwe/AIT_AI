## Original Abstract

In this paper, we present our experiment and simulation study of a free piston linear engine based on operating conditions and structure of the linear engine for generating electric power. The free piston lin-ear engine includes a two-stroke free piston engine, linear generators, and compressors. In the experi-mental study, the effects of key parameters such as input caloric value, equivalence ratio, spark timing delay, electrical resistance, and air gap length on the piston dynamics and electric power output  are investigated. Propane is used as a fuel in the free piston linear engine, and it is premixed with the air to make a homogeneous charge before go into the cylinder. The air and fuel mass flow rate are varied by a mass flow controller. The experimental results show that the maximum generating power is found with the value of 111 W at the input caloric value of 5.88 kJ/s, spark timing delay of 1.5 ms, equivalence ratio of 1.0, electric resistance of 30 X, and air gap length of 1.0 mm. In order to check the durability of the linear engine, a durable test is conducted during 100 h. The experimental results show that there are no problems for the linear engine after about one hundred hours of the durable test. Beside experimental study, a simulation study is conducted to predict operating behavior of the linear engine. In the simula-tion study, the two-stroke free piston linear engine is modeled and simulated through a combination of three mathematical models including a dynamic model, a linear alternator model and a thermodynamic model. These mathematical models are combined and solved by a program written in Fortran. Besides, the effects of key parameters such as reciprocating mass, spark timing and spring stiffness on the piston dynamics and electric power output of the linear engine are also investigated. The simulation results show that the simulation and experimental data are nearly similar at the same initial conditions. In addi- tion, a highest generating power of the linear engine can be easily found by optimizing the key parameters.

This study presents a comprehensive experimental and simulation analysis of a free piston linear engine (FPLE) for efficient electric power generation. The research investigates a prototype comprising a two-stroke free piston engine, linear generator, and compressors, with propane used as premixed fuel. Key engine parameters, including input caloric value, equivalence ratio, spark timing delay, electrical resistance, and air gap length, are systematically varied using mass flow controllers to evaluate their effects on piston dynamics and electrical output. Experimental results demonstrate that maximum power generation (111 W) is achieved at an input caloric value of 5.88 kJ/s, a spark delay of 1.5 ms, equivalence ratio of 1.0, resistance of 30 Ω, and air gap length of 1.0 mm. Durability testing over 100 hours confirms the engine’s operational stability. In parallel, a multi-physics simulation integrates dynamic, alternator, and thermodynamic models implemented in Fortran, allowing investigation of the influence of reciprocating mass, spark timing, and spring stiffness on system performance. Simulation outcomes correlate closely with experimental data, verifying model accuracy, and reveal that optimal power output can be efficiently achieved by tuning critical engine parameters. These findings validate FPLE technology’s potential for reliable small-scale power generation when appropriately engineered and controlled.
