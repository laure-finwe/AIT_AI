  "original_abstract": "The design of biomaterial scaffolds for bone regeneration has traditionally focused on optimizing static properties like porosity and mechanical strength, largely disregarding the dynamic, multi-phase nature of the healing process. Here, we introduce the concept of architectural programming—the deliberate engineering of a scaffold's pore network to control the kinetics of mass transport and degradation, thereby aligning its function with the temporal progression of healing. Using a solvent-cast poly(L-lactic acid)/poly(ε-caprolactone) (PLLA/PCL) base, we created two distinct architectures: a 40 wt% Klucel formulation exhibiting \"democratic porosity\" (high specific surface area of 15.46 m²/g; low closed porosity of 8.8%) and a 20 wt% PVA formulation with \"programmed latency\" (high closed porosity of 21.5%; superior intrinsic permeability of 3.17×10⁻⁵). These architectural differences yielded a 289-fold greater acidic flux in the Klucel scaffold, functioning as a built-in \"exhaust fan\" to clear cytotoxic degradation byproducts. Kinetic modeling confirmed staged functionality: Klucel exhibited rapid, Fickian release and swelling (24 h), while PVA showed anomalous, erosion-coupled release and gradual hydration (72 h). Crucially, we identify a determinative architecture-additive interaction: the Klucel scaffold's high-flux network is catastrophically clogged by hydroxyapatite particles, reducing cell viability to ~20%, whereas the PVA scaffold maintains biocompatibility. This work establishes architectural programming as a new paradigm for designing biomaterials that actively orchestrate the healing timeline, with broad implications for regenerative medicine.",

  "corrected_abstract": "The development of biomaterial scaffolds for bone regeneration has often prioritized static properties, such as porosity and mechanical strength, while insufficiently addressing the dynamic and multi-phase nature of tissue healing. Current scaffold design approaches are limited in their ability to control the spatial and temporal evolution of mass transport and degradation, factors critical for supporting the sequential stages of bone repair and regeneration. In this study, we present the concept of *architectural programming*—the purposeful design of a scaffold’s pore network to modulate mass transport kinetics and degradation behavior in accordance with the temporal progression of bone healing.\nUsing solvent-cast poly(L-lactic acid)/poly(ε-caprolactone) (PLLA/PCL) as the base matrix, we engineered two distinct scaffold architectures by incorporating different porogens: a 40 wt% Klucel (hydroxypropylcellulose) formulation, resulting in ‘democratic porosity’ (high specific surface area of 15.46 m²/g and low closed porosity of 8.8%), and a 20 wt% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) formulation yielding ‘programmed latency’ (high closed porosity of 21.5% and intrinsic permeability of 3.17×10⁻⁵). Here, *closed porosity* refers to isolated pores not contributing to bulk permeability. Comparative analyses revealed that the Klucel scaffold exhibited a 289-fold increase in acidic flux relative to the PVA scaffold, thus acting as an efficient conduit for the removal of acidic degradation byproducts. Kinetic modeling demonstrated the staged function of each architecture: Klucel scaffolds underwent rapid, Fickian water uptake and byproduct release within 24 hours, while PVA scaffolds displayed a slower, erosion-coupled release and hydration profile over 72 hours.",
