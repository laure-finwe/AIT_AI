  "original_abstract": "3D sand mould printing using binder jet technology can enable many technical improvements in casting practice, including part consolidation, design of parts to\noptimise the consumption of materials and hazardous chemicals, and on-demand and flexible size part manufacturing near the customer. Incorporating artificial\nintelligence in optimising the design of moulds, printing process parameters, and solidification processes may help automate a production facility and reduce labour\ntime. Elimination of hazardous chemicals from industrial use may be a challenge. Therefore, an alternative technology to fuse the sand particles during printing or an\nenvironmentally friendlier alternative option for the binders and other consumables should be utilised with the 3D sand printing process. Properties of parts produced\nusing 3D printed sand moulds have the potential to be better than the properties of parts produced using traditional casting due to this technology’s benefits. This\ntechnology is an enabling technology for traditional casting processes rather than a competing technology. It is causing a paradigm shift in casting design because of\nthe mould geometries achievable by using additive manufacturing to produce the sand mould. This paper reviews the first twenty years of research and challenges in\ndeveloping 3D sand printing processes as an innovation for sustainable manufacturing.",

  "corrected_abstract": "This abstract presents a critical evaluation of 3D sand mould printing using binder jetting technology, emphasizing its technical, environmental, and industrial implications for sustainable metal casting. The binder jetting process enables precise fabrication of complex sand moulds, improving dimensional accuracy and reducing tooling lead times compared to traditional methods. Environmentally, 3D printing reduces material waste and energy consumption by minimizing excess sand and optimizing binder usage, contributing to more eco-friendly foundry operations. Industrial adoption of this technology enhances production efficiency, supports flexible manufacturing, and enables integration of digital workflows in casting processes. Overall, 3D sand mould printing via binder jetting represents a significant advancement toward sustainable manufacturing practices within the metal casting industry.",
